## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Cities are increasingly investing in sensors. One of the initiatives is connecting traffic lights with the Internet.
<!-- Need         -->
To retrieve insights and attain better policies from these data, it is crucial that the historical data are accessable and preservable.
<!-- Task         -->
We propose (i) an ontology for describing the topology of an intersection and the signal timing of traffic lights, (ii) a specification to publish these historical and live data with Linked Data Fragments and (iii) a method to preserve the published data in the long-term.
We showcase the applicability of our specification with the opentrafficlights.org project where an end-user can see the live count-down as well as a line chart showing the historic 'time to green' of a traffic light.
<!-- Object       -->

<!-- Findings     -->
We found that publishing traffic lights data as time sorted Linked Data Fragments allow mechanisms for synchronising and reusing an archive to retrieve historical observations. Long-term preservation with tape storage becomes feasible when archives shift from byte preservation to knowledge preservation by combining Linked Data Fragments.
<!-- Conclusion and Perspectives -->
<!--Cities can collaborate with archiving institutions for the long-term preservation of timeseries data.-->
