## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
For better traffic flow and making better policy decisions, the city of Antwerp is connecting traffic lights to the Internet.
<!-- Need         -->
The live “time to green” only tells a part of the story: also the historical values need to be preserved and need to be made accessible to everyone.
<!-- Task         -->
We propose (i) an ontology for describing the topology of an intersection and the signal timing of traffic lights, (ii) a specification to publish these historical and live data with Linked Data Fragments and (iii) a method to preserve the published data in the long-term.
We showcase the applicability of our specification with the opentrafficlights.org project where an end-user can see the live count-down as well as a line chart showing the historic “time to green” of a traffic light.
<!-- Object       --><!-- Findings     -->
We found that publishing traffic lights data as time sorted Linked Data Fragments allow synchronizing and reusing an archive to retrieve historical observations.
Long-term preservation with tape storage becomes feasible when archives shift from byte preservation to knowledge preservation by combining Linked Data Fragments.
<!-- Conclusion and Perspectives -->
<!--Cities can collaborate with archiving institutions for the long-term preservation of timeseries data.-->
