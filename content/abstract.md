## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Cities are increasingly investing in sensors. One of the initiatives is connecting traffic lights with the Internet.
<!-- Need         -->
To retrieve insights and attain better policies from these data, it is crucial that the historical data are accessable and preservable in a low-cost fashion.
<!-- Task         -->
We propose (i) an ontology for describing the topology of an intersection and the signal timing of traffic lights, (ii) a specification to publish these historical and live data with Linked Data Fragments and (iii) a method to preserve the published data in the long-term.
We showcase the applicability of our specification with the opentrafficlights.org project where an end-user can see the live count-down of a traffic light as well as a line chart showing historic 'time to green'.
<!-- Object       -->

<!-- Findings     -->
We found that publishing the data as time sorted Linked Data Fragments allow mechanisms for long-term preservation which are efficient for archiving institutions that use tape libraries.
<!-- Conclusion and Perspectives -->
By making these data available on the Web, a collaboration from cities with archiving institutions becomes more feasible for long-term preservation of timeseries data.
