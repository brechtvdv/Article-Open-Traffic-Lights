## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Cities are increasingly investing in sensors. One of the initiatives is connecting traffic lights with the Internet.
<!-- Need         -->
To retrieve insights and attain better policies from these data, it is crucial that the historical data are accessable and preservable in a low-cost fashion.
<!-- Task         -->
We propose (i) an ontology for describing the topology of an intersection and the signal timing of traffic lights, (ii) a specification to publish these historical and live data with Linked Data Fragments and (iii) a method to preserve the published data in the long-term.
We showcase the applicability of our specification with the opentrafficlights.org project where an end-user can see the live count-down of a traffic light as well as a line chart showing historic 'time to green'.
<!-- Object       -->

<!-- Findings     -->
We found that publishing traffic lights data as time sorted Linked Data Fragments allow mechanisms for synchronising and re-using an archive to retrieve historical observations. By focusing on knowledge preservation instead of byte preservation, fragments can be merged into bigger files. This increases the feasability to use tape storage for long-term preservation of sensor data.
<!-- Conclusion and Perspectives -->
By making these data available on the Web, cities can collaborate with archiving institutions for the long-term preservation of timeseries data.
