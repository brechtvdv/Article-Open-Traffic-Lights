In this demo we applied rich snippets as a cost-efficient Linked Open Data interface to a newspaper website (cfr. [hetarchief.be](https://hetarchief.be) ) and showcased how a spreadsheet can be extracted from it by extending the query engine Comunica. Organisations can harvest a up-to-date export such as a spreadsheet or make federated queries with other Linked Data interfaces (cfr. Wikidata). While this is a cheap method of data publishing, a client needs to fetch multiple fragments to answer a question. The current implementation of Comunica only works with next-links pagination which doesn't help the client filtering relevant fragments. Future work needs to be done how other hypermedia controls (free text search, geospatial features...) can benefit the querying speed and how Linked Data services can be made on top of the
