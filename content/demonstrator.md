## Demonstrator
{:#demonstrator}

A demonstrator showing how a spreadsheet can be extracted from a website using SPARQL querying can be found as a Codepen at [https://codepen.io/brechtvdv/pen/ebOzXB](https://codepen.io/brechtvdv/pen/ebOzXB). A user can insert a URL that serves as an access point of the dataset. After pressing the "Start download" button, the browser compatible version of Comunica starts fetching the access URL and all other webpages it can find through embedded hypermedia controls. Also the user can set a SPARQL-query to select the data for the columns in the spreadsheet. While fetching, results get streamed back and can be copied to a spreadsheet software.

[Hetarchief.be](https://hetarchief.be) is a website containing more than 50 000 digitized newspapers published during the first World War. The Flemish Institute for Audiovisual Archiving [VIAA](https://viaa.be) reaches its community with this human-friendly website providing multiple search facets. To support the Linked Data initiative, they applied rich snippets to its website which means that every [newspaper subject page](https://hetarchief.be/nl/media/brief-van-den-soldaat-aan-zijne-verdrukte-medeburgers/I2STYUAOpmFKmbFRXNmV0PTp) corresponds with one Linked Data Fragment. Editorial changes are automatically applied to the rich snippets keeping VIAAs Linked Data interface  up-to-date.

There are three hypermedia links added:
